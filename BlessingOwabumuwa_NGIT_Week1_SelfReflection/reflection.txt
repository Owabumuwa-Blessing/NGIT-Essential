Understanding computers, operating systems, and how the web works is essential for any web developer.
This knowledge helps write efficient, secure, and reliable code by showing how the CPU, memory, and file system operate.
Understanding the internet, servers, and browsers makes it easier to debug problems and optimize applications.
It also enables developers to write faster and more secure code.
Without this foundational knowledge, it would be difficult to understand how websites are built and delivered to users.
Overall, these fundamentals make learning programming easier, more effective, and prepare developers to build scalable, reliable systems.
