1.  A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to
    instructions to produce meaningful information. Hardware refers to
    the physical parts of a computer, while software refers to the
    programs and instructions that run on the hardware. Examples of
    hardware: keyboard, monitor, hard drive. Examples of software:
    Windows OS, Microsoft Word, Google Chrome.

2.  An operating system is system software that manages computer
    hardware and software resources. Two primary functions are:

-   Managing hardware resources such as memory, CPU, and storage.
-   Providing an interface for users to interact with the computer.

3.  Differences between Windows and Linux:

-   Windows is a commercial operating system, while Linux is
    open-source.
-   Windows is generally more user-friendly for beginners; Linux is more
    customizable and used by developers.
-   Windows requires a license, while most Linux distributions are free.

4.  Definitions:

-   File: A collection of data stored on a computer with a specific
    name.
-   Folder (Directory): A container used to organize and store files and
    other folders.
-   File extension: The suffix at the end of a file name that indicates
    its type, such as .txt, .jpg, or .html.

5.  The command line is a text-based interface used to interact with the
    computer by typing commands. It is important for developers because
    it allows faster navigation, automation, and control over
    development tools and systems.

6.  Internet-related terms:

-   Server: A computer that provides resources or services to other
    computers.
-   Browser: A software application used to access and view websites.
-   IP Address: A unique number assigned to a device on a network.
-   DNS: A system that converts domain names into IP addresses.
-   HTTP and HTTPS: Protocols used to transfer data on the web. HTTPS is
    the secure, encrypted version of HTTP.

7.  The client–server model is a system where a client requests services
    and a server provides them. Example: When you type a website address
    into a browser, the browser (client) sends a request to a web
    server, and the server sends back the webpage.

8.  Frontend development deals with the visual part of a website that
    users interact with, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Backend development handles the server, databases, and
    application logic that power the website behind the scenes.

9.  A website is a collection of web pages. A domain is the address used
    to access the website (e.g., google.com). Hosting is the service
    that stores website files on a server. They work together because
    the domain points to the hosting server where the website is stored.

10. The browser rendering process starts when a user enters a URL. The
    browser sends a request to the server, receives the HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript files, and then processes them. It builds the page
    structure, applies styles, runs scripts, and finally displays the
    webpage on the screen.
